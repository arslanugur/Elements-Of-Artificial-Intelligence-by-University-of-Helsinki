Supervised Learning
-What is ML?
	The art and science of:
		Giving computers the ability to learn to make decisions from data
		Without being explicitly programmed
	Examples
		Learning to predict whether an email is spam or not
		Clustering wikipedia entries into different categories
    
    
    
    
	Supervised Learning	: Uses labeled data
		- predictor variables/features and a target variable
		- Aim: Predict the target variable, given the predictor variables
			Classification: Target variable consists of categories
			Regression: Target variable is continuous

		- Naming Conventions
			Features = predictor variables = independent variables
			Target variable = dependent variable = response variable

    		- Automate time-consuming or expensive manual tasks
			Ex: Doctor's Diagnosis
		- Make Predictions about the future
			Ex: Will a customer click on an ad or not?
		- Need Labeled Data
			Historical Data with labels
 			Experiments to get labeled data
			Crowd-sourcing labeled data 
      
      		Supervised learning in Py
	     		 - We will use scikit-learn/sklearn
		     		 - Integrates well with the Scipy stack
	          	 - TensorFlow
	        	 - Keras
            
	Unsupervised Learning 	: Uses unlabeled data
		- Uncovering hidden patterns from unlabeled data
		- Example: Grouping customers into distinct categories (Clustering)
	Reinforcement Learning	: Software agents interact with an environment
					- learn how to optimize their behaviour
					- given a system of rewards and punishments
					- draws inspiration from behavioral psychology

# Which of these is a classification problem?
	Once you decide to leverage supervised machine learning to solve a new problem, 
	you need to identify whether your problem is better suited to classification or regression. 
	This exercise will help you develop your intuition for distinguishing between the two.

	A supervised classification problem: Using labeled financial data to predict whether the value of a stock will go up or go down next week.  
	 In this example, there are two discrete, qualitative outcomes: 
	 the stock market going up, and the stock market going down. 
	 This can be represented using a binary variable, and is an application perfectly suited for classification.
	 
	 In each of the examples, think about what is being predicted. 
	 Is this predicted value quantitative or qualitative? 
	 In classification problems, the outcome is qualitative - that is, it can be described using a categorical variable.
