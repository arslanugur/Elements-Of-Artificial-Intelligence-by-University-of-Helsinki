Supervised Learning
-What is ML?
	The art and science of:
		Giving computers the ability to learn to make decisions from data
		Without being explicitly programmed
	Examples
		Learning to predict whether an email is spam or not
		Clustering wikipedia entries into different categories
    
    
    
    
	Supervised Learning	: Uses labeled data
		- predictor variables/features and a target variable
		- Aim: Predict the target variable, given the predictor variables
			Classification: Target variable consists of categories
			Regression: Target variable is continuous

		- Naming Conventions
			Features = predictor variables = independent variables
			Target variable = dependent variable = response variable

    - Automate time-consuming or expensive manual tasks
			Ex: Doctor's Diagnosis
		- Make Predictions about the future
			Ex: Will a customer click on an ad or not?
		- Need Labeled Data
			Historical Data with labels
 			Experiments to get labeled data
			Crowd-sourcing labeled data 
      
      Supervised learning in Py
	      - We will use scikit-learn/sklearn
		      - Integrates well with the Scipy stack
	          - TensorFlow
	          - Keras
            
	Unsupervised Learning 	: Uses unlabeled data
		- Uncovering hidden patterns from unlabeled data
		- Example: Grouping customers into distinct categories (Clustering)
	Reinforcement Learning	: Software agents interact with an environment
					- learn how to optimize their behaviour
					- given a system of rewards and punishments
					- draws inspiration from behavioral psychology
