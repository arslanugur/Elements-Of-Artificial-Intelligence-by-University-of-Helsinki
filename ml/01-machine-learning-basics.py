Machine Learning Basics
      #To use several Python packages that are helpful in solving Machine Learning problems. 
      #Pandas is used for reading data and data manipulation, 
      #numpy is used for computations of numerical data, 
      #matplotlib is used for graphing data, and scikit-learn is used for machine learning models. 

      #Supervised learning is when we have a known target based on past data 
      #(for example, predicting what price a house will sell for)
      #deal with Prediction
      
      #Unsupervised learning is when there isn't a known past answer 
      #(for example, determining the topics discussed in restaurant reviews)
      #deal with Deduction
      
      #Supervised Learning
      #Within supervised learning, there are classification and regression problems. 
      #Regression is predicting a numerical value (for example, predicting what price a house will sell for)
      #Classification is predicting what class something belongs to (for example, predicting if a borrower will default on their loan)
 
"""      
      Classification problems where we’re predicting which class something belongs to.
      Our examples will include:
      • Predicting who would survive the Titanic crash
      • Determining a handwritten digit from an image
      • Using biopsy data to classify if a lump is cancerous

      To use a number of popular techniques to tackle these problems.
      • Logistic Regression
      • Decision Trees
      • Random Forests
      • Neural Networks

      #Unsupervised learning : Clustering problem, Non-clustering problem. 
      #Regression problem examples
      #Prediction of continuous data
      #Target variables that are of continuous values. In other words, numerical data (-inf to +inf, percentage, etc.)

      
      #Classification problem examples
        #Target variables that are of discrete values. In other words, categorical data (yes/no, 1/0, etc.)
        #Prediction of limited number of outputs. Like yes/no
        #Determining if an image is of a car, bus or bike
        #Predicting if a credit card charge is fraudulent
