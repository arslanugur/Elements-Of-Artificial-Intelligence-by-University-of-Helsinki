Spreadsheet that calculates sums and other pre-defined functions on given data 
---> No
The outcome is determined by the user-specified formula, no AI needed.

Predicting the stock market by fitting a curve to past data about stock prices
---> Yes
Fitting a simple curve is not really AI, but there are so many different curves to choose from, 
even if there's a lot of data to constrain them, that one needs machine learning/AI to get useful results.

A GPS navigation system for finding the fastest route
---> Yes
The signal processing and geometry used to determine the coordinates isn't AI, 
but providing good suggestions for navigation (shortest/fastest routes) is AI, 
especially if variables such as traffic conditions are taken into account.

A music recommendation system such as Spotify that suggests music based on the users' listening behavior
---> Yes
The system learns from the users' (not only your) listening behavior.

Big data storage solutions that can store huge amounts of data (such as images or video) and stream them to many users at the same time
---> No
Storing and retrieving specific items from a data collection is neither adaptive or autonomous.

Photo editing features such as brightness and contrast in applications such as Photoshop
---> No
Adjustments such as color balance, contrast, and so on, are neither adaptive nor autonomous, 
but the developers of the application may use some AI to automatically tune the filters.

Style transfer filters in applications such as Prisma that take a photo and transform it into different art styles (impressionist, cubist, ...)
---> Yes
Such methods typically learn image statistics 
(read: what small patches of the image in a certain style look like up close) and transform the input photo so that its statistics match the style, 
so the system is adaptive.
