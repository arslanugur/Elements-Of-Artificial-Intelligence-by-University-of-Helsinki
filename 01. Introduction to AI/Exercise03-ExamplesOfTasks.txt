Consider the following example tasks. Try to determine which AI-related fields are involved in them. 
Select all that apply. (Hint: machine learning involves almost always some kind of statistics).
Note: This exercise is meant to inspire you to think about the different aspects of AI and their role in various applications. 
As there are no clear-cut answers to many of these questions, this exercise will not be included in the grading. 
Nevertheless, we suggest that you do your best and try to answer as well as you can, but don't worry if our answers will differ from yours.

- Autonomous car
Autonomous cars apply a wide range of techniques to function. These include statistics, robotics, and machine learning.

- Steering a rocket into orbit
In order to steer a rocket into orbit "robotics" are needed to fire the engines at the right times and with the right power.

- Online ad optimization
In order to optimize ads online, machine learning and statistics are needed to deliver the correct type of ads to the right audience, 
and to measure the effectiveness of the optimization.

- Customer service chatbot
A customer service chatbot will need "machine learning" to process human produced language in such a way that it can act on it.

- Summarizing gallup results
Summarizing gallup results is a classical case of using "statistics" to produce insights.
